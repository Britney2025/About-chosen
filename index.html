    <h2><u>About me</u></h2>
    <p>
        My name is Britnie Atieno. I am currently a student at Zindua School, trying to explore new 
        opportunities in education while growing my creative side. I am a crochet artist and I run a 
        small crochet brand, Looped by Chosen. As a passionate crocheter, I love creating handmade pieces
        that reflect style and creativity.

        As an introvert, I'm on a journey to self-discovery - learning to express myself, find my voice 
        and build confidence. I'm learning to grow both personally and professionally.
